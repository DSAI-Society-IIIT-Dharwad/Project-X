    "content": "Study:\n\nPopulation size:  766, human\n\nLead Researcher:  Benozzi, Argentina\n\nPresented:  Sept 2025\n\nStudy design:  retrospective, eye drops, active ingredients: \n\n* pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and \n\n* diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.\n\nResults:  found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on a standard eye chart, reducing dependence on reading glasses.\n\nCommentary/caution:  Prof Burkhard Dick (ESCRS President-Elect, chair, ophthalmology dept at Uni Eye Hosp in Germany), commented: some patients are not candidates for surgery to repair age-related near vision loss. Benozzi\u2019s study suggests that eye drops (containing pilocarpine and diclofenac) may improve near vision, but the study design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. More studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.\n",

    "content": "Biologists at the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a have reported initial success in their programme to raise European pond turtles \u2013 the only species of turtle native to Poland \u2013 with the aim of reintroducing them into the wild in the region, where they are believed to be extinct.\n\nIn an update issued on Wednesday regarding their efforts to \u201crestore the king of Polish waters\u201d, the researchers revealed that all 50 of the turtles they reared last year have survived. In the wild, only around 1% of hatchlings survive due to predation.\n\n\n\nIt represents a major step in a long-term project to restore European pond turtles in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a province, where they are considered extinct. Around 150 turtles are expected to be released into two landscape parks in the province over the coming years.\n\nThe programme, run jointly by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Orientarium Zoo and several regional institutions, raises young turtles in controlled yet naturalistic conditions to protect them from predators during their most vulnerable early years.\n\nThe hatchlings are brought to the zoo from Polesie National Park in eastern Poland, where a successful breeding programme has helped establish the country\u2019s largest European pond turtle population, estimated at around 1,500.\n\n\n\nThey then spend three years in specially prepared indoor enclosures designed to mimic natural conditions while keeping out threats such as foxes and\u00a0[raccoons](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/04/29/racoon-resists-rescue-attempts-after-falling-asleep-on-a-streetlamp-in-poland/).\n\nThe turtles are exposed to fluctuating temperatures, sunlight and natural UVB, and must find food themselves \u2013 measures designed to maintain their instincts for survival in the wild.\n\nTwo cohorts of 50 turtles have already been brought to the zoo, in September 2024 and September 2025. The first group has achieved a 100% survival rate, with the university reporting that the turtles \u201chave grown significantly and are in excellent condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cBigger equals safer,\u201d the university\u2019s department of biology wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cBreeding allows the young to grow larger, which dramatically increases their chances of survival once released into the wild.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce common across central Poland, the European pond turtle declined sharply due to habitat loss, water pollution, wetland drainage and predation by invasive species. The turtles were placed under strict protection as early as 1935 and are now threatened with extinction.\n\nThe long-term goal of the project is to rebuild self-sustaining wild populations and restore the species\u2019 presence in the region.\n\n\u201cThe European pond turtle has disappeared from our region mainly due to human activity \u2013 wetland drainage, pollution and predation. Now, by joining forces, we have a chance to reverse this trend,\u201d said the department of biology.",

    "content": "*From the beginning of the pandemic, we were hopeful that vaccines would be developed that would prevent all variants of covid (\u201csterilizing\u201d). This study hints that Novavax vaccine prevents covid and is broad spectrum - they aren\u2019t making bold claims here but the language is there. However, there are significant study limitations:  no controls and a (stated) conflict of interest.*\n\nSimpler language version:\n\n### Study Intro\n\nLead Researcher:  Zhu (salaried employee of Novavax and holds stock)\n\nPublished\n- [Oct 21, 2025, Journal of Medical Virology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70645)\n- [Jan 2025 preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.21.25320906v1)\n\nStudy size:  347 (human)\n\n- When evaluating vaccines, most studies measure  IgG (immune response in **blood**), but IgA (the body\u2019s immune response in **mouth and nose** (saliva and mucus) is more potent to protect against early covid infection.  This study measured IgA in saliva.\n\n- Participants:  had received 2 or more mRNA vaccines\n\n- Study protocol:  Saliva collected prior to receiving Novavax and again 28 days later. \n\n- Results:  increase in IgA against 4 variants (XBB.1.5, JN.1, Wuhan, and Wild) an indicator of **broad spectrum** cross-variant protection.\n\n### Study Summary\n1. Rapid responses in mouth and nose (saliva and mucus) are key in fighting the virus and **reducing transmission** (viral shedding) \n2. Recommendation:  nasal spray vaccines, for a localized IgA response where the virus enters the body.  \n3. We need more studies focused on **mucus IgA** (to take advantage of its strengths, improve immune responses, increase long-term cross-reactivity, and define ideal levels) \n\n###Author states these study limitations:\n- Participants did not represent a broad age range (only age 12-17 represented)\n- Relatively small study\n- Though this study recommends nasal vaccines, the study did not evaluate effectiveness of nasal spray vaccines.\n\n(*I notice a study limitation not mentioned in the published study:   study design did not compare Novavax to mRNA and did not include controls.*)",

Have any of you ever wanted to distance yourself from a group you been in for a while? \n\nLong story short the group is OK. The problem I have with them is that many of them are against making money, capitalism, and some of the members are very selfish only talking to those who they can get something from and every conversation with them revolves around them and what they need/want and the rest of the group is OK with that but not me. They make mods and the make it for free and I make both mods and gaming assets to sell to game developers. Most of them don't have the skills I got and the one that does rarely ever responds to anyone as they are also busy trying to make money. \n\nThe selfish part really bothers me as for a long time in my life I been used by many people and people never so much as to even try to return the favor in your time of need. So I did some soul searching and found out why I attract such people. I want nothing to do with users online and offline. \n\nI always wanted to work in the gaming and 3d  industry and my skills allow me to do just that\n\nI want to find like minded people who are trying to grow, challenge themselves, and are supportive. I understand that all people are selfish to an degree but there are those who are willing to help others and there are those who are only out for themselves. I want to be in a group of people who help others and have a growth mind set. \n\nEver since I started this journey I keep thinking of things from a business prospective.

    "content": "Zerodha's Coin platform will launch Fixed Deposits (FDs) on the platform in a fortnight, according to a couple of sources familiar with the matter. The FD product is being launched in partnership with a fintech startup, Blostem, a New Delhi-based startup that has raised close to $1 million in funding.\n\nZerodha founders\u2019 investment arm Rainmatter Capital will also lead a new round of funding in the startup, along with the formalisation of the partnership, one of the sources added. However, the quantum of the investment could not be confirmed.\n\nCoin is a separate app from Kite, the direct stock investment and trading app of Zerodha. Coin is the primary platform for long-term investments, including Mutual Funds, Sovereign Gold Bonds, government securities, and the National Pension Scheme.\n\nBlostem\u2019s other investors include AC Ventures, mobile payments firm Mobikwik and Delhivery founder Kapil Bharti.\n\n**Digital FDs without a savings account**\n\nThe fully digital process will enable consumers to open FDs without having to open a savings bank account with the same financial institutions. The FDs will most likely be with Small Finance Banks, which offer higher interest rates than commercial banks.\n\nCoin platform lets consumers invest in commission-free direct mutual funds without any fees or platform/distributor commission. It is also Zerodha\u2019s platform for the popular Systematic Investment Plan (SIPs) and has an Assets Under Management to the tune of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.\n\n**Zerodha philosophy**\n\nThe Bengaluru-based discount broker\u2019s idea behind FDs is to offer fixed-income products along with low-risk long-term investment products on the Coin platform.\n\n\u201cKite remains the short-term or active investment platform, while Coin will become the passive investment platform, where consumers put money and forget. You come back to withdraw after a few years,\u201d one of the sources quoted above said.\n\nAccording to the source, most investors indulge in panic or impulse buying and selling often and a segregation of long-term and short-term investments is a good way to maximise the returns.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why we have Coin as a separate app for SIPs, NPS and mutual funds, even though most other wealth-tech startups tend to offer it on the same app, even though it limits our growth through cross-selling,\u201d the source added.\n\nMoneycontrol was the first to report on October 27 that\u00a0[Zerodha will launch US stock investment](https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/zerodha-to-offer-investment-in-us-stocks-in-next-quarter-through-gift-city-article-13633744.html)\u00a0next quarter.\n\nThe flurry of new product launches comes even as the company reported\u00a0[a decline in revenue and net profits](https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/zerodha-revenue-drops-for-the-first-time-in-fy-25-sebi-regulations-to-hit-fy-26-topline-by-40-article-13591717.html)\u00a0for the first time in over a decade.\n\n**FDs on fintech platforms**\n\nThe FD space is attracting heightened interest from startups as well as the venture capital industry. A fortnight ago, Moneycontrol reported that Peak XV Partners is set to lead around $25 million funding round in wealthtech startup Stable Money.\n\nZerodha founders\u2019 investment fund Rainmatter-backed smallcase and WintWealth also offer FDs on the platform, although FDs are not their primary product. Flipkart-backed\u00a0[super.money](http://super.money/)\u00a0also offers digital FDs on its platform.",

I\u2019m currently based in the UK but originally from Latin America, and I\u2019ve been reflecting on how to enter this field from a social science background.\n\nOne challenge I\u2019ve noticed is that many roles in space policy seem tailored to people with law degrees, which can make it difficult to see where someone with training in sociology, policy, science and technology studies or international development might fit in. Still, I\u2019m very interested in contributing to the broader new space economy \u2014 particularly where questions of governance, sustainability, and equity intersect with emerging space technologies.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from others who\u2019ve navigated similar paths or have advice on how to build a career in this space (no pun intended!) \u2014 whether that means additional training, fellowships, or ways to get involved in ongoing initiatives.",

    "content": "Recently I\u2019ve been wondering about the possible connection between cosmological expansion and the Fermi Paradox, and I\u2019d really like to know how people here think about it.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, only a small fraction of the observable universe is actually causally accessible to us, maybe just a few percent. Because of the accelerating metric expansion of space, most galaxies are now receding faster than light, meaning we can still see them (from the light they emitted billions of years ago), but we can never reach or communicate with them.\n\nThat made me think: if 95% or more of the observable universe is already beyond any possible causal contact, doesn\u2019t that drastically reduce the \"pool\" of potential civilizations we could ever detect or interact with? It wouldn\u2019t explain the lack of signals within our own galaxy, but it would mean that most of the universe (including any intelligent life that might exist there) is simply cut off forever.\n\nI imagine this isn\u2019t a new thought, but I\u2019d love to hear from people who know more:\n- How do cosmologists or astrobiologists approach this question?\n- To what extent is cosmological inaccessibility considered a relevant factor in explaining the Fermi Paradox?\n- Is it discussed at all in the literature, or mostly seen as unrelated because Fermi\u2019s question applies mainly at galactic scales?\n\nI\u2019m not arguing this \"solves\" the paradox, just trying to understand how significant (or not) this aspect of physics is in the broader discussion.",

    "title": "No, the IAWN conducting a training exercise to better understand comets \u2260 \"NASA activating interplanetary defense\"",
    "content": "I'm seeing so many posts on this sub lately, a lot of people who unfortunately have been misled by the media trying to spin sensational narratives like they always do, about the Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. One of the newer ones has been the claim that \"NASA is activating interplanetary defense against 3I/ATLAS\" - a completely bogus claim with no links to reality, not even superficially.\n\n\nHere's what the reality is: \n\nFirstly, this has nothing to do with \"NASA\" because NASA itself is not conducting this. And a lot of nonsensical claims about \"NASA being silent right now\" fail to remind themselves that NASA as an agency is shut down right now - as far as I can see they were quite active and healthy in their discussion about 3I/ATLAS prior to lapse in funding.\n\nSecondly:\n\nFrom IAWN's official website - https://iawn.net/obscamp/3I_ATLAS/\n\n>\"While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity for the IAWN community to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community.**This 3I/Atlas campaign is the 8th IAWN observing exercise since 2017 - IAWN holds these exercises roughly once a year.** IAWN had been planning to do a Fall 2025 comet campaign since 2024 to exercise capabilities for measuring the position of comets, which pose additional astrometric challenges as they appear as fuzzy extended objects compared to point-like asteroids in a telescope's field of view.\"\n\n\nIn short, the workshop above has one simple goal: better data. Comets like 3I/ATLAS are notoriously hard to measure. Their comas can shift a telescope\u2019s readings by thousands of kilometres. Getting an opportunity to better observe something especially not from our solar system would give us a much richer breadth of data for future observations/risk assessment.\n\nThis interstellar comet in particular poses NO threat. Instead of sensational fearmongering about little green men, we all need to make it a rule to read beyond *just* headlines. Always, and I mean *always* seek official data/study, not someone else's report on it - it cuts right through 99% of BS spreading online nowadays.",

Shouldn't the first star's light be well over with by this point? It's almost as if when the big bang happened, we popped up further away than the first stars for us to be able to see it, if that makes any sense. And if it's because the expansion of the universe is faster than light, then we wouldn't be able to see it in real time because we would've been moving away quicker than the light could get to us from the very beginning, right? \n\nIt's might be hard to understand the logic from how I'm trying to word it, but I hope someone understands and can explain it to me!",

    "content": "* When a planet transits its star, it blocks part of the rotating stellar surface. Because one side of the star is moving toward us and the other side is moving away, the observed stellar spectrum is slightly distorted, causing an apparent shift in the star\u2019s radial velocity. This is called Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect. It depends on stellar rotation, planet to star radius ratio, orbital inclination and alignment.\n* Here Measured obliquities in hot-star sub-Saturn systems are not exactly 90\u00b0, but cluster around \\~65\u00b0, which accords with a theoretical idea called Secular resonance crossing mechanism. It is slow, long-term gravitational process where the planet\u2019s orbit gets tilted (to near-polar) because its orbital motion and the star\u2019s spin motion match.\n* source: [https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20740v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.20740v1)",

Suppose a fairy godmother allowed us to achieve this.\n\nObviously, the first craft will take hundreds of years to reach the destination, and time will pass pretty much the same way for it and us Earthlings. However, the second one is what I don't get.\n\nTo an outside observer, the second craft will reach the destination in just over 10 Earth years. But:\n\n*What do the crew on board experience? Inside the craft moving at a relativistic velocity, time should pass slower, right? How long would the crew say the journey took them?\n\n*Us Earthlings would count as outside observers, and the ship's journey would still look like it took 10ish years, right?\n\n*Finally, if I had a twin brother on the ship, how much older or younger than me will he be once they reach destination and magically stop without any ill effects?\n\nSorry if this sounds silly, but I would appreciate a simple explanation without Einstein's formulas.
