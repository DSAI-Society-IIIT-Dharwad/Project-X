    "title": "8 days until the return of something humanity was never meant to remember: 3I/ATLAS is coming back",
    "content": "In 2019 astronomers detected an object entering our solar system on a hyperbolic trajectory officially named 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar visitor after \u2018Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Unlike Borisov, which behaved like a normal comet, 3I/ATLAS showed several anomalies: its brightness fluctuated irregularly, its acceleration couldn\u2019t be fully explained by outgassing, and its albedo reflected a metallic, non-natural pattern.\nAstrophysicist Avi Loeb, former chair of Harvard\u2019s Department of Astronomy, was among the first to suggest that \u2018Oumuamua and possibly 3I/ATLAS could represent artificial probes sent by an extraterrestrial civilization. Loeb\u2019s reasoning was simple: both objects lacked the expected cometary tails, yet exhibited accelerations inconsistent with gravitational or solar radiation effects. Their shapes, inferred from light curves, were unusually flat and reflective possibly resembling light sails designed for interstellar travel.\nBut now, all of a sudden, with a bunch of days left before the interstellar object gets closer to us, global summits of extreme importance are suddenly cancelled (Putin-Trump), lockdowns of satellite arrays and quiet movements of high ranking officials (US military official suddenly called all togheter for the first time ever). Bunkers has been built all across the globe over the last few years and the elite moved to safer and hidden locations. Why? They know what's coming.\n\nAncient myths across cultures describe \u201cmessengers from the stars\u201d returning after vast cycles, the Sumerian Annunaki, the Egyptian Shemsu-Hor, the Mayan Kukulkan, or the Dogon legends of beings from Sirius. The mathematical precision embedded in monuments like the Great Pyramid of Giza, Teotihuac\u00e1n, and Tiwanaku aligns eerily with astronomical constants and stellar positions that were supposedly impossible to calculate with ancient technology.\n\nAdvanced life on earth existed in the past, civilizations more developed than us used to walk on this planet before the Sumers, for suddenly disappearing, leaving by just a few traces. All of them were connected to something from the outside.\n3I/ATLAS is not as a random interstellar fragment, but a part of a recurrent cycle, a return of an ancient, intelligent technology that once visited Earth thousands of years ago and left behind architectural and cultural fingerprints.\nPerhaps what ancient civilizations called \u201cgods descending from the heavens\u201d were not divine beings, but observers, and 3I/ATLAS could be their signal that the observation is about to begin again.\nEight days left. Scientists expect the object to navigate through our solar system in a predictable way and ahead out. But it won't. There's nothing predictable about it. Its orbit will suddenly change and ahead straight to Us, and whatever comes next will be a turning point in human history, hands down the most important event ever. It could either be the end of life as we know it, or the biggest turning point in our history.\n\nSomething ancient and out of our comprehension is returning. Enjoy these two months, because after, nothing will ever be the same.\n\nEight days left.",

    "content": "A day ahead of\u00a0Tesla\u2019s\u00a0quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a\u00a0website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new\u00a0pay package\u00a0for CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.\n\nTesla\u2019s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package \u201coutrageous,\u201d in part because Musk\u2019s \u201cpolitical activities have damaged Tesla\u2019s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.\u201d The site says the plan doesn\u2019t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n\u201cPublic pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,\u201d the site says. \u201cThat\u2019s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.\u201d\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ek\u014d, People\u2019s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have\u00a0recommended\u00a0against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk\u2019s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.\n\nFollowing those firms\u2019 suggestions, Tesla wrote in a\u00a0post\u00a0that, \u201cISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla\u2019s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.\u201d The company added that shareholders who sold would \u201chave missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery\u00a0ruled\u00a0early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.\n\nMusk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.\n\nAround the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his social network X, \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having \\~25% voting control.\u201d The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.\n\nMusk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nBy May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least\u00a0five more years.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he \u201cvociferously opposes this pay package\u201d and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.\n\n\u201cMost of the time we\u2019ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it\u2019s grown over time, and that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t chosen to dump it,\u201d Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he\u2019s preferred to \u201chold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.\u201d\n\nLander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.\n\nHe said he views Tesla\u2019s board he as \u201cinsufficiently independent,\u201d and that it\u2019s allowed Musk to be an \u201cabsentee CEO.\u201d The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.\n\nThe stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it\u2019s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.\n\nMusk has \u201cbeen an inconsistent CEO at best,\u201d Lander said, \u201cand the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nTesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year\u00a0declines.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/take-back-tesla-urges-shareholders-to-reject-musk-1-trillion-pay-plan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/take-back-tesla-urges-shareholders-to-reject-musk-1-trillion-pay-plan.html)",

    "content": "Tesla\u00a0Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s nearly $1 trillion\u00a0pay package\u00a0ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nDenholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being \u201cjust another car company,\u201d with a bigger focus on\u00a0Full Self Driving\u00a0and\u00a0Optimus.\n\n\u201cWithout Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,\u201d Denholm wrote.\n\nDenholm told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Monday that the company is at an \u201cimportant inflection point\u201d with artificial intelligence at the forefront.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor\u00a0Institutional Shareholder Services\u00a0recommending against it.\n\nLast week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the\u00a0Take Back Tesla\u00a0website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk\u2019s embracing of\u00a0right-wing\u00a0political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.\n\nTesla\u2019s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the\u00a0shareholder vote\u00a0for Musk\u2019s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.\n\nTesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing\u00a0earnings\u00a0expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.\n\nThe proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain\u00a0milestones.\n\nIt would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has\u00a0publicly demanded\u00a0for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla\u2019s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.\n\n\u201cIf we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\u201d Musk said to analysts. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don\u2019t have at least a strong influence.\u201d\n\nThe full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can\u2019t happen with the AI,\u201d Denholm told CNBC. \u201cSo it\u2019s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.\u201d\n\nDenholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla\u2019s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.\n\nShe also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/tesla-musk-pay-shareholder-vote.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/tesla-musk-pay-shareholder-vote.html)",

    "content": "In my division and department, we are being encouraged to use Microsoft CoPilot quite a bit for work tasks that do not include confidential information. This concerns me quite a bit because of the economically destructive use of AI in many sectors of our economy. AI is quite literally destroying jobs that humans would otherwise have in many different industries right now. For example, this is especially the case in the legal profession where entry level associates are being replaced with AI chatbots to do basic legal functions. This is one widely reported example, but there are many other instances of AI already taking the place of people in today's economy.\n\nMy deputy director has suggested using AI to work \"smarter not harder\" in order to automate items that could be done through AI faster and easier than with a human employee. If it wasn't already clear, AI has the humongous potential (and some would say goal) of being able to replace humans in the highest number of jobs possible, especially office desk jobs.\n\nAnd as mentioned in the video below, we can accurately predict the outcome of new and disrupting technologies such as AI when we can identify the incentives. The incentives in this case are clear. The more work that can be done by AI, the less need there are for expensive human workers to be hired. It may happen more slowly in state employment than private industry because of protections from being laid off, but with nothing to challenge it, AI would likely considerably reduce state employment opportunities by allowing management to simply not backfill roles after workers leave their positions.\n\nIs anyone else's management pushing the use of AI? Do others have similar concerns as this?\n\nWhat are our unions doing about this? I think we need to make a bigger deal about this to our unions and push them to address it before it becomes such a large issue that it's too hard to sufficiently reign it in.\n\nHere is a great video with Jon Stewart talking with Tristan Harris (Co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology) about the dangers of Unregulated AI on Humanity & the Workforce. While some of the scenarios they describe are more extreme than what we would likely encounter at the state, they nonetheless illustrate the dangerous potential of AI: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=675d\\_6WGPbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=675d_6WGPbo)",
