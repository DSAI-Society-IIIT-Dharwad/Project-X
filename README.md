Key Code Explanations
Scraper Dynamic Filtering
python
def scrape_monitored_subreddits(reddit, subreddits=None, limit=None):
    if subreddits is None:
        # Uses dashboard selection or fallback defaults.
        subreddits = MONITORED_SUBREDDITS
    ...
    for subreddit_name in subreddits:
        # Only scrapes what the user selects.
Dashboard Source Preview
python
def get_source_preview(source_name, source_type='reddit'):
    ...
    # Extract top keywords from recent titles.
    words = [w.lower() for title in titles for w in title.split() if len(w) > 4]
    top_keywords = [word for word, count in Counter(words).most_common(5)]
Filter UI in Dashboard
python
selected_reddit = st.multiselect(
    "Select subreddits:",
    options=filtered_reddit,
    default=[],
    key="reddit_filter"
)
